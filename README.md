# CountingSheeps
Just a powershell script i use at work, as right-click option.

It just looks for the context a file is invoked upon.
And then renames it/moves it/whatevers it according to our internal conventions.

Im learning powershell as i write and expand it. Its bound to have some ugly and some clever code.

The manual is for coworkers who may want to use it.
